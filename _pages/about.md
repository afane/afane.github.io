As a Fulbright Scholar and machine learning researcher, I study the intersection of algorithms and society, 
focusing on public health, robustness and reliability of LLMs, efficient machine learning, and quantum computing. 

I'm particularly interested in developing machine learning methods that support robust and equitable decision making, and exploring how AI systems can be used to their full potential while ensuring safety, reliability, and fairness.
